**** Bumping version numbers, for components that change (or whose static dependencies change) ***

  RNMobileCenter Android
    mobile-center-sdk-react-native/RNMobileCenter/android/build.gradle
      Add 1 to versionCode (it's just a counter that need be unique)
      Bump the version in versionName
      Ensure com.microsoft.azure.mobile:mobile-center (at the bottom) is correct

  RNMobileCenter iOS
    mobile-center-sdk-react-native/RNMobileCenter.podspec
      Bump the version num s.version
      Ensure s.dependency 'MobileCenter' dependency (at the bottom) is correct

  NPM modules
    mobile-center-crashes/package.json
    mobile-center-crashes/scripts/postlink.js
    mobile-center-crashes/android/build.gradle (versionCode, versionName, and dependences at bottom)

    mobile-center-analytics/package.json
    mobile-center-analytics/scripts/postlink.js
    mobile-center-analytics/android/build.gradle (dependences at bottom)

    mobile-center-link-script/package.json

*** Building for iOS ***

- Download the latest Mobile Center frameworks zip from https://github.com/Microsoft/mobile-center-sdk-ios/releases.
  - Unzip it.
  - Open up RNMobileCenter/ios/RNMobileCenter.xcodeproj in Xcode
  - Drag in MobileCenter.framework; check "Copy items if needed"; Add to the RNMobileCenter target
  - Switch the scheme to "Fat framework" (Product/Scheme menu)
  - Ensure the Destination is Generic iOS Device (though I'm not sure it matters); ensure the "Fat Framework" target is selected
  - Build (Product / Build For / Running)
  - For validation do:
    cd RNMobileCenter
    file  ./Products/RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter
    And confirm you see output like this:
    RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter: Mach-O universal binary with 4 architectures: [arm_v7: current ar archive random library] [i386: current ar archive random library] [x86_64: current ar archive random library] [arm64: current ar archive random library]
    RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter (for architecture armv7):    current ar archive random library
    RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter (for architecture i386):    current ar archive random library
    RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter (for architecture x86_64):    current ar archive random library
    RNMobileCenter/RNMobileCenter.framework/RNMobileCenter (for architecture arm64):    current ar archive random library  

  - Zip up the framework:
    cd mobile-center-sdk-react-native/RNMobileCenter
    ./zip-framework.sh

*** Publishing for iOS ***
  - If desired as a sanity check, download the old zip, unzip, and diff its contents with the contents of the new zip, to ensure all looks as expected.
  - Create a new release draft here https://github.com/Microsoft/mobile-center-sdk-react-native/releases
  - Rename MobileCenter-SDK-ReactNative-iOS-Pod-0.x.x.zip to have the right version number & drag/drop it into the release definition
  - Publish the release; it will tag the source, so ideally try to make sure it's matched to the binary

  To publish the updated CocoaPod:
  - cd mobile-center-sdk-react-native
  - Ensure you are a contributor to the cocopod; if you aren't, have the original contributor add your email address as a maintainer
  - Create a session (using your name and email):  pod trunk register joe.blow@microsoft.com 'Joe Blow' --description='macbook pro'
  - Click on the link in the email that arrives to complete creating the session
  - Lint the update:
    pod spec lint RNMobileCenter.podspec  --allow-warnings

    The only warning should be:  There was a problem validating the URL https://mobile.azure.com.
  - Publish the update:
    pod trunk push RNMobileCenter.podspec --allow-warnings
  - As a double check, ensure that everything looks OK with the published podspec here:  https://cocoapods.org/?q=RNMobileCenter

*** Building and publishing for Android ***
  - Log into bitrise, go to "mobile-center-sdk-react-native: Android & npm", click Start/Schedule a Build, click Advanced, and change Workflow to "publish-bintray"

  - Validate that it's published here:  https://bintray.com/mobile-center  (login with GitHub auth)
    It should get replicated to jcenter, for public consumption, a few minutes after it's published in bintray.

*** Building and publishing npm ***
  - Log into bitrise, go to "mobile-center-sdk-react-native: Android & npm".
  - Navigate to the last build for the "primary" workflow, or kick off a new build with click Start/Schedule a Build, building the default workflow (primary).
  - Download from artifacts the npm packages you wish to update.
  - If desired as a sanity check, diff the new packages with previously published package tgz files, to ensure all the changes are as expected.
    Beyond Compare can do diffs inside of a tgz.
  - Login to npm with:
    npm login
    Username: mobilecenter
    Password: <provide this>
    Email: mobilecentersdk@microsoft.com
  - Publish with commands like:
    npm publsh mobile-center-analytics-0.2.0.tgz
  - Validate that it's published here:  https://www.npmjs.com/~mobilecenter

*** Building the Demo app ***

  - Build Demo app
  - cd into MobileCenterDemoApp folder and npm install
  - run react-native link to hook up the native sources and specify app secret
  - Run Demo app
  - cd into MobileCenterDemoApp folder and react-native run-ios


*** More info *** 

  More about the fat framework build process:

  Just to be clear: this is what I mean about the "fat framework" only running a script
  that script invokes the build on the RNMobileCenter target a few times and builds the different archs and puts it all together
  and it looks like the script does build it in release mode
  To see the script:  select RNMobileCenter's root elemetn, select Fat Framework, go to the Build Phases tab, and there is a Run Script target
