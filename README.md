# AppCenter SDK for React Native

AppCenter is your continuous integration, delivery and learning solution for iOS and Android apps.
Get faster release cycles, higher-quality apps, and the insights to build what users want.

The AppCenter SDK uses a modular architecture so you can use any or all of the following services: 

1. **AppCenter Analytics**: AppCenter Analytics helps you understand user behavior and customer engagement to improve your app. The SDK automatically captures session count, device properties like model, OS version, etc. You can define your own custom events to measure things that matter to you. All the information captured is available in the AppCenter portal for you to analyze the data.

2. **AppCenter Crashes**: AppCenter Crashes will automatically generate a crash log every time your app crashes. The log is first written to the device's storage and when the user starts the app again, the crash report will be sent to AppCenter. Collecting crashes works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to the App Store. Crash logs contain valuable information for you to help fix the crash.

3. **AppCenter Push**: AppCenter Push enables you to send push notifications to users of your app from the AppCenter portal. We use APNs for iOS apps and FCM for Android. You can also segment your user base based on a set of properties and send them targeted notifications.

## 1. Get started
It is super easy to use AppCenter. Have a look at our [get started documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/getting-started/react-native) and onboard your app within minutes. Our [detailed documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/) is available as well.
